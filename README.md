A Project created for UP Diliman's CS21: Computer Organization and Architecture course

## Project Summary üìù

This project implements backtracking algorithms in MIPS assembly language to solve both 4x4 and 9x9 Sudoku puzzles. The algorithm was designed with scalability in mind, minimizing the need for variable adjustments when transitioning between different puzzle sizes. Sudoku puzzles are represented as one-dimensional arrays in MIPS, aligning with the constraints of the assembly language environment.
